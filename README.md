# CSE470-Project
This is my project for CSE470 course. I have developed an E-commerce Website by following mvt pattern for this project.
All the tests files are under their respective apps. Like App_Login has one tests.py file and all the test classes and functions for App_Login app are in this tests.py file.
Similarly, App_Order, App_Payment, App_Shop have their respective tests classes and methods in their respective tests.py file.
